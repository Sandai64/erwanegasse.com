= This release of Ubuntu is no longer supported =

You are about to upgrade to a version of Ubuntu that is no longer
supported.

This release of Ubuntu is '''no longer supported''' by Canonical. The
support timeframe is between 9 months and 5 years after the initial
release. You will not receive security updates or critical
bug fixes. See http://www.ubuntu.com/releaseendoflife for details.

It is still possible to upgrade to this version and eventually you
will upgrade to a supported release of Ubuntu.

Alternatively you may want to consider to reinstall the machine to the
latest version, for more information on this, visit:
http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu.

For pre-installed system you may want to contact the manufacturer
for instructions.
